Solution to [WATER problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WATER)

## Problem description
On a rectangular mesh comprising *n&ast;m* fields, *n&ast;m* cuboids were put, one cuboid on each field.
A base of each cuboid covers one field and its surface equals to one square inch.
Cuboids on adjacent fields adhere one to another so close that there are no gaps between them.
A heavy rain pelted on a construction so that in some areas puddles of water appeared.
